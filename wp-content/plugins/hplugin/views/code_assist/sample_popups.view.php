                	The core framework has a built in popup window system. Popup windows are populated with HTML snippets. Snippets are scoped to make use of framework CSS - this allows 
                    developers to make use of framework components and styles within their HTML snippets. There are 3 required methods when launching a popup: a method to run when the 
                    popup is launched (this will only be called once the HTML snippet has been successfully loaded), a method to run when the popup "Update" button is clicked and a method to run the  
                    popup "Cancel" button is clicked - the framework will make the JSON object available to all 3 functions. The launch method can be used to populate the HTML snippet that has been 
                    loaded into the popup. The update method can be used to persist changes in the popup window data back to the View Core object.
