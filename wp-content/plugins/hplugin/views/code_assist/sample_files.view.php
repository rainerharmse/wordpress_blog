                    can be stored.

                <p>
                	The framework has been designed to integrate seamlessly with WordPress. The plugin class structure has been predefined to allow for a uniform architecture across all 
                    plugins and to allow for 'clean' code separation - These classes are contained within "classes/core/".

                <p>
                	A helper class has been generated and included within the plugin framework to assist with plugin development. This class is automatically instantiated and made 
                    available via PHP globals - to make use of this class within a method, use "global $&lt;plugin_name&gt;_helper;". You can append to this class but do not remove 
                    any existing methods as some of them are used by the framework.

                <p>
                	The framework has been designed to execute certain code blocks based on WordPress events - Activate plugin, Deactivate plugin and Update plugin. The "activate_plugin.class.php" 
                    is executed upon activating the WordPress plugin - this is where all DB tables should be generated. The "update_plugin.class.php" is used when the plugin is upgraded - this
                    should be used to modify any DB tables if changes have been made since a previous version.

                	The "backend.class.php" file should be used for all admin development. This class is automatically instantiated and used for all AJAX hooks. If you require additional backend
                    classes, please ask for advise on the best possible implementation.
